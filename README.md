# Supplymedia
Supplymedia was create to tackle the issue of finding medical and health supplies during 
crisis and pandemic related times. In a social media type interface, users are able to upload
the type of supply (such as a face mask) that they have found,the availability of the supply 
and a picture proof of the supply. They can then post the supply on the feed which other users can 
then take a look at. The other users are then able to find what store has the supply available and
can then purchase it from the store. Supplymedia's feed displays the picture, the user's name who posted the photo, the availability, the city and the store to help users find the nearest available store that someone has posted that has the supply they need in it.
